# iW-S
This is created to display my program project on iOS application based on Markdown. This place is used to record all the learning process and ideas about this project. 
## Reference 
- I read the open source code [edhita](https://github.com/tnantoka/edhita/tree/Objective-C) written in Objective-C to achieve a better user markdown typing experience. 
- I'm also learning Swift in order to make it happen that the Swfit-based markdown app[edhita](https://github.com/tnantoka/edhita) is also a good learning source. 

## Goals
1. Master both Objective-C and Swift languages. 
2. Learn the UI Design by using Sketch 3.
